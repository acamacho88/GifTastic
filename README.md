# GifTastic

This app will display a number of gifs found using the Giphy API relating to the button you press.

To add a new button and display gifs related to that button, you can enter it into the text field on the side.

If you click on the gif you can animate it or stop its animation depending on its current state.

This has been deployed to Github pages and can be accessed here: https://acamacho88.github.io/GifTastic/
